## Contact Methods

### 1. GitHub Repository Issue (RECOMMENDED - PUBLIC)
- **Repository:** https://github.com/mks0601/ConvNeXtPose (original repo)
- **Fork:** https://github.com/EstebanCabreraArbizu/ConvNeXtPose
- **Action:** Create new issue with GITHUB_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md content
- **Advantage:** Public visibility helps other users, creates permanent record

### 2. IEEE Access Contact
- **Paper URL:** https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288440
- **Action:** Check paper PDF for author email addresses (usually in first page footer or author affiliations)
- **Typical format:** `author.name@university.edu`

### 3. Research Profiles
Search for authors on:
- **Google Scholar:** https://scholar.google.com/
- **ResearchGate:** https://www.researchgate.net/
- **LinkedIn:** Professional networking
- **ORCID:** Academic identifier system

### 4. University Affiliations
Based on typical Korean research institutions:
- Check affiliations in IEEE paper
- Contact through university department websites
- Look for lab/research group pages

## Recommended Approach

### Step 1: Create GitHub Issue (Do This First)
```bash
# Navigate to original repository
# Click "Issues" tab
# Click "New Issue"
# Paste content from GITHUB_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
# Add label: bug, documentation
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Public and transparent
- ‚úÖ Helps other users with same problem
- ‚úÖ Authors typically monitor GitHub issues
- ‚úÖ Creates permanent documentation

### Step 2: Direct Email (If No Response in 1 Week)
1. Download paper PDF from IEEE: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288440
2. Check first page and author affiliations for email addresses
3. Send email using EMAIL_TEMPLATE_AUTHORS.md
4. Attach CHECKPOINT_MISLABELING_ISSUE.md

**Email Subject Line:**
```
Request for Model L and M Checkpoints - ConvNeXtPose (IEEE Access 2023)
```

### Step 3: Follow Up (If No Response in 2 Weeks)
- Post on ResearchGate asking to connect
- Try LinkedIn professional message
- Comment on related posts/papers

## Message Priority

**High Priority Information:**
1. ‚úÖ We successfully set up the testing pipeline
2. ‚úÖ Checkpoint conversion works perfectly
3. ‚ùå Downloaded files contain wrong architecture
4. üôè Requesting correct Model L and M checkpoints

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Technical analysis is complete and documented
- Not a setup/configuration issue - verified mislabeling
- Ready to test immediately with correct files
- Want to validate and cite their excellent work

## Expected Timeline

| Action | Expected Response Time |
|--------|------------------------|
| GitHub Issue | 1-7 days (if actively maintained) |
| Email | 1-14 days (varies by author availability) |
| ResearchGate | 1-30 days (less formal channel) |
| LinkedIn | Varies widely |

## Backup Plan (If No Response)

If authors don't respond after reasonable time:

### Option 1: Train Your Own Models
- Use provided training code
- Train Model L and M from scratch
- Requires significant GPU resources (days/weeks)
- Cost: ~$100-500 on cloud GPU

### Option 2: Use Model S
- Test with available Model S checkpoint
- Document that L and M are unavailable
- Report results for S only (~45mm MPJPE expected)
- Note limitation in research/report

### Option 3: Contact Original PoseNet Authors
- ConvNeXtPose builds on PoseNet
- Original repo: https://github.com/mks0601/3DMPPE_POSENET_RELEASE
- They may have insights or contacts

## Documents Ready to Send

‚úÖ **CHECKPOINT_MISLABELING_ISSUE.md** - Complete technical report  
‚úÖ **EMAIL_TEMPLATE_AUTHORS.md** - Professional email draft  
‚úÖ **GITHUB_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md** - GitHub issue content  
‚úÖ Analysis scripts and results - Evidence of mislabeling  

## Next Steps

1. **TODAY:**
   - [ ] Access IEEE paper to find author emails
   - [ ] Create GitHub issue on original repository
   - [ ] Send initial email to corresponding author

2. **WEEK 1:**
   - [ ] Monitor GitHub issue for responses
   - [ ] Check email for replies

3. **WEEK 2:**
   - [ ] Follow up if no response
   - [ ] Try alternative contact methods

4. **MEANWHILE:**
   - [x] Test Model S to validate pipeline works
   - [x] Document all findings
   - [x] Prepare to report results with available data

## Notes

- Be professional and appreciative in all communications
- Acknowledge their contribution to the field
- Emphasize desire to validate and cite their work
- Provide complete technical details to show serious intent
- Offer to share results once obtained

**Remember:** Researchers are often busy. Give reasonable time for response before following up.
